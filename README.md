# Practical Programming and Numerical Methods

This repository contains material for the *Practical Programming and Numerical Methods* course at Aarhus University for the year 2025.

Course information is available on the [course homepage](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/).

Students are free to choose their preferred programming language; I have chosen **C#**.

The course is structured around a series of programming assignments, including exercises, homework, and ultimately an examination project. My solutions to these assignments can be found in the corresponding folders.
