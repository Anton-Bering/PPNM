# Practical Programming and Numerical Methods

This is my repository for the *Practical Programming and Numerical Methods* course at Aarhus University, spring 2025.

Course information is available on the [course homepage](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/).

As students, we have been free to choose our preferred programming language; I have chosen **C#**.

The course is structured around a series of programming assignments, including *exercises*, *homework*, and ultimately an *examination project*. My solutions to these assignments can be found in the corresponding folders.
