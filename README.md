# Practical Programming and Numerical Methods

This is my repository for the *Practical Programming and Numerical Methods* course at Aarhus University, spring 2025.

Course information is available on the [course homepage](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/).

As students, we have been free to choose our preferred programming language; I have chosen **C#**.

The course is structured around a series of programming assignments, including *exercises*, *homework*, and ultimately an *examination project*. My solutions to these assignments can be found in the corresponding folders.

The homework assignments are the following:  
[1) Linear Equations](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/lineq.htm)  
[2) Eigenvalues / EVD (Eigenvalue Decomposition)](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/eigenvalues.htm)  
[3) Least-Squares / Ordinary Least-Squares Fit](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/least-squares.htm)  
[4) Splines](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/splines.htm)  
[5) ODE](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/ode.htm)  
[6) Integration / Recursive Adaptive Integration](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/quadratures.htm)  
[7) Monte Carlo / Monte Carlo integration](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/montecarlo.htm)  
[8) roots / Root Finding](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/roots.htm)  
[9) Minimization](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/minimum.htm)  
[10) neural network / Artificial Neural Networks](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/neural-network.htm)
