------------ TASK A: Newton's method with numerical Jacobian and back-tracking line-search ------------

------ Use your own routines for solving linear systems ------

--- Solving a linear system Ax=b ---

The system is defined by matrix A and vector b:
A =
      4.0000       1.0000       2.0000 
      1.0000       5.0000       3.0000 
      2.0000       3.0000       6.0000 

b = 12.00000000 20.00000000 26.00000000 

The expected solution is (1, 2, 3).

The solver finds the solution:
x = 1.00000000 2.00000000 3.00000000 

------ Test your root-finding routine using one- and two-dimensional equations ------

--- Finding root for f(x) = (x-5)^2 - 4 ---

The expected solutions are x=3 and x=7.

Searching from starting point x=1.0:
  Root found at x = 2.99999991 
  f(3.0000) = 0.00000037

Searching from starting point x=8.0:
  Root found at x = 7.00001024 
  f(7.0000) = 0.00004096


--- Finding root for f(x,y)=(x+y-5, x^2-y-1) ---

The expected solutions are (x,y)=(2,3) and (x,y)=(-3,8).

Searching from starting point (1,1):
  Root found at (x,y) = 2.00013016 2.99986984 
  f(2.0001, 2.9999) = (0.00000000, 0.00065081)

Searching from starting point (-2,7):
  Root found at (x,y) = -3.00007629 8.00007629 
  f(-3.0001, 8.0001) = (0.00000000, 0.00038148)

------------ (Here is a small comment related to Task C:                ------------
------------  In the analysis below, I use the 'na√Øve implementation'.) ------------

------ Find the extremum(s) of the Rosenbrock's valley function ------

Expected minimum is (x,y)=(1, 1).

Rosenbrock minimum found at:
  x = 1.00000255 1.00000505 

------ Find the minimum(s) of the Himmelblau's function ------

Expected minima are (3, 2), (-2.805, 3.131), (-3.779, -3.283), and (3.584, -1.848).

Minimum found from start point (4,4): 2.99999912 2.00000396 
Minimum found from start point (-2,2): -2.80511924 3.13131265 
Minimum found from start point (-3,-4): -3.77931155 -3.28319145

------------ TASK B: Bound states of hydrogen atom with shooting method for boundary value problems ------------

------ Find the lowest root, E_0, of the equation M(E)=0 ------

Calculated ground state energy: E0 = -0.49997520 Hartree

------ Plot the resulting wave-function and compare with the exact result ------
------ (which is: E_0 = -1/2, f_0(r) = r e^(-r)                           ------

------ Investigate the convergence of the solution  ------
------ (with respect to r_max, r_min, acc, and eps) ------

Convergence data for r_min saved to Hydrogen_convergence_rmin.txt

Convergence data for ODE accuracy (eps) saved to Hydrogen_convergence_eps.txt

------------ TASK C: Quadratic interpolation line-search ------------

------ Optimize the implementation by only allocating one matrix ------
------ in the beginning and then updating it at each step.       ------
------ And implement the quadratic interpolation line-search ------

For this purpose, I have implemented the function NewtonOptimized (in RootFinder.cs),
which is an optimized version of the Newton function.

To check that the optimizations work, the analyses from Task A and B are run once again,
but using the function 'NewtonOptimized' instead of 'Newton'.
The results for this are shown below:
