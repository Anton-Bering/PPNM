# Homework "[Artificial Neural Networks](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/neural-network.htm)"

## Tasks

### A. In this homework we shall construct a simple artificial neural network which will be trained to interpolate a tabulated function.

Train your network to approximate some intersting function

### B.  Modify the previous exercise such that the network, after training, could also return the first and second derivatives and also the anti-derivative of the approximant to the tabulated function. A gaussian wavelet could be a good activation function here as both its derivatives and the anti-derivative are analytic.

### C.  Implement an artificial neural network that can be trained to approximate a solution to the differential equation: Φ[y(x)]≡Φ(y'',y',y,x)=0
