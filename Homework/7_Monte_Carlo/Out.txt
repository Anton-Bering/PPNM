The file 'Estimate_LessSungularIntegral.txt' contains the results for the value of the less sungular 3D Integral.
After 100 samples, the estimated value is 0.039423781.
The plot 'Estimate_LessSungularIntegral_error.plot' shows the estimated and actual error as a function of N.
As shown in the plot, the error scales approximately as N^(-1/2), as expected from theory.

 ------------ TASK B ------------

------ Estimated the error by using two different sequences ------

Estimate_QMC_vs_MC.txt contains the data for the estimated errors.
Estimate_QMC_vs_MC_error.svg is a plot showing the estimated and actual error for MC and QMC as a function of N.
The QMC error is estimated as the absolute difference between two independent Halton sequence evaluations.

------ Compare the scaling of the error with my pseudo-random Monte-Carlo integrator ------

QuasiVsPseudoResults.txt contains the estimated and actual errors for both MC and QMC.
Estimate_QMC_vs_MC_error.svg is a log-log plot visualizing the error scaling as a function of N.
QMC achieves lower error and faster convergence compared to MC, especially for smaller sample sizes.

--- Part B: Quasi-Random vs Pseudo-Random Monte Carlo ---
Integrand f(x,y) = x*y over [0,1]^2 (true value = 0.250000)

(MC uses internal variance; QMC uses difference of two sequences.)

 ------------ TASK C ------------
This task implements recursive stratified sampling, where the domain is adaptively subdivided based on estimated sub-variances.
The integrator distributes more points where the function varies most, improving accuracy in difficult regions.
The method is recursive and stops subdividing when the number of points is below a fixed threshold (nmin).

StratifiedSamplingErrors.txt contains error data for plain vs stratified MC.
StratifiedSamplingError.svg shows the actual error as a function of N in log-log scale.


--- Part C: Recursive Stratified Sampling ---
Integrating 1000*exp(-100x - 10y) on [0,1]^2 (true value ≈ 0.999955) with N=10000
Plain MC:      result = 1.004034,  error estimate = 0.178803,  actual error = 0.004079
Stratified MC: result = 0.990924,  error estimate = 0.003179,  actual error = 0.009031
