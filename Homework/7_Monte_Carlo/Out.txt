------------ TASK A ------------

------ Calculate two-dimensional integrals with my Monte Carlo routine ------
------ Plot the estimated error and the actual error as functions of the number of sampling points ------
------ And check whether the actual error scales as N^(-1/2) ------

--- Area of Unit Circle ---
Processed N=1000
Processed N=2000
Processed N=3000
Processed N=4000
Processed N=5000
Processed N=6000
Processed N=7000
Processed N=8000
Processed N=9000
Processed N=10000

The file 'Estimate_the_area_of_a_unit_circle.txt' contains the Monte Carlo estimates of the unit circle area.
After 10000 samples, the estimated area is 3.140000.
The plot 'area_of_a_unit_circle_error.plot' shows the estimated and actual error as a function of N.
As shown in the plot, the error scales approximately as N^(-1/2), as expected from theory.

--- Calculating Gaussian Bell Integral ---
Processed N=1000 for Gaussian Bell
Processed N=10000 for Gaussian Bell

The file 'Estimate_GaussianBell2D.txt' contains the Monte Carlo estimates of the area.
After 10000 samples, the estimated area is 3.065652.
The plot 'Estimate_GaussianBell2D_error.plot' shows the estimated and actual error as a function of N.
As shown in the plot, the error scales approximately as N^(-1/2), as expected from theory.
