# Artificial Neural Networks

In this folder is my solution to the 10th homework assignment (week 22).  

The full description of the assignment can be found [here](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/neural-network.htm).

## Tasks

**A)** construct a simple artificial neural network (6 points)   
**B)** Modify the previous exercise such that the network, after training, could also return the first and second derivatives and also the anti-derivative of the approximant to the tabulated function (3 points)  
**C)** Implement an artificial neural network that can be trained to approximate a solution to a differential equation (1 points)
