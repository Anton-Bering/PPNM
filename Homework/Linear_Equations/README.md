The full description of the assignment can be found [here](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/lineq.htm).

## Objective

Implement functions to do the following:

**1)** Solve linear equations  
**2)** Calculate matrix inverse  
**3)** Calculate matrix determinant  

The method used is the *modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization*.

## Tasks

**a)** Solve linear equations using QR-decomposition by modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (6 points)   
**b)** Compute matrix inverse using Gram-Schmidt QR factorization (3 points)  
**c)** Count the number of operations for QR-decomposition (1 points)
