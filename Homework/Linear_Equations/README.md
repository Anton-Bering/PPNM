The full description of the assignment can be found [here](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/homeworks/lineq.htm).

## Objective

Implement functions to do the following:

1. Solve linear equations  
2. Calculate matrix inverse  
3. Calculate matrix determinant  

The method used is the **modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization**.

## Tasks

- **(6 points)** Solve linear equations using QR-decomposition by modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization  
- **(3 points)** Compute matrix inverse using Gram-Schmidt QR factorization  
- **(1 point)** Count the number of operations for QR-decomposition
