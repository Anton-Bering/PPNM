--- PART A ---

-- Testing the routines by solving the ordinary differential equations (ODE) ---

In sho_data.txt and sho_plot.png is the data and plot, respectively, from solving: u''=-u
In exp_data.txt and exp_plot.png is the data and plot, respectively, from solving: dy/dx = y
In poly_data.txt and poly_plot.png is the data and plot, respectively, from solving: y'' = 6x
For comparison, the plots also contain the analytical solutions.
