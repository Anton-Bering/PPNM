------------ TASK A ------------

------ Make some indicative plots to prove the linear spline and the integrator work as intended ------

--- Take the table: {x_i=0,1,...,9; y_i=cos(x_i)} and plot its linear interpolant ---
--- together with interpolant's anti-derivative                                   ---

The data is in cos.txt and the plot is in cos.svg
--- Take the table: {x_i=0,1,...,9; y_i=x_i^2} and plot its linear interpolant ---
--- together with interpolant's anti-derivative                                ---

The data is in quad.txt and the plot is in quad.svg

------------ TASK B ------------

------ Make some indicative plots to prove that the quadratic spline ------
------ and the integrator work as intended                           ------

--- Using {x_i=0,1,...,9; y_i=sin(x_i)} ---

The data is in sin.txt and the plot is in sin.svg.

--- Using {x_i=0,1,...,9; y_i=ln(x_i+1)} ---

The data is in log.txt and the plot is in log.svg.

------ Calculate manually the parameters {b_i, c_i} of the corresponding quadratic-splines ------
------ And compare the results with the quadratic-spline program ------


 For Sin(x):
The manually calculated values are in Manually_calculate_bi_and_ci_sin.txt.
The program-computed values are in Computed_bi_and_ci_sin.txt.
The manual and program-computed values are compared visually in the plot bi_and_ci_comparing.svg.


 For ln(x+1):
The manually calculated values are in Manually_calculate_bi_and_ci_log.txt.
The program-computed values are in Computed_bi_and_ci_log.txt.
The manual and program-computed values are compared visually in the plot bi_and_ci_comparing_log.svg.


------------ TASK C ------------

------- Check that the built-in cubic splines in Gnuplot produce a similar cubic spline to the implementation ------

The results from my implementation are in sqrt.txt, and the plot is in sqrt.svg.
In sqrt_comparing.svg, a comparison is shown between my results (from sqrt.txt) and the built-in Gnuplot spline (using the data in sqrt_data_points_to_Gnuplot.txt).
