# Examination Project: "Quasi-Newton Minimization with Broyden's Update of the Hessian Matrix"

This folder contains my solution for my examination project.

In total, there are 32 different [examination projects](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/projex/projects.php) (numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., 32). As students, we have each been assigned one of these projects as our exam project to solve.

My exam project is number 29: [Quasi-Newton Minimization with Broyden's Update of the Hessian Matrix](https://fedorov.sdfeu.org/prog/projex/minimum-broyden.htm).
